# Information for Auditing the Course

## NOTE: This document is a draft and is subject to change

Thank you for your interest in auditing MAS.S62, Cryptocurrency Design and Engineering!

We're excited to offer the opportunity to audit this course to any computer science faculty who might be
interested in teaching this course at their own university in the
future. This means you can:

* Attend lectures remotely (via Zoom)
* Access all course material
* Join office hours remotely (via Zoom)
* Complete assignments and get grades and feedback
* Participate in the class discord

We do not support:

* Sharing recordings of lectures immediately after each class
* Auditors outside of computer science faculty (the course will be available for free via MIT OCW after completion)
* In-person visits
* Accreditation or enrollment at MIT
* Languages other than English

The course schedule is available
[here](https://github.com/mit-dci/cde-2025). Please fill out this form
to sign up to audit the course by August 28th, 2025 (TBD). The first
lecture is Thursday, September 4, 2025 at 11 AM ET.
